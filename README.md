h. Special instructions for deploying app

None.

i. What? Yeah.

j. Instructions to use app 

To use the app, first deploy on an iPhone. Place the Ground Target (see resources) on a flat surface, with the Travel Target next to it (along it's length) and have the Wand Target in your hand. Then as you launch the app, select any option from the Start menu by focusing your gaze on any menu option, and play the game.

In the game, translate/rotate the Wand and Travel Target to respectively translate/rotate the active brick and game board. 

Pause or exit the to the Main Menu at any time by selecting the appropriate menu items floating next to the game board. 

k. Possible next steps and gameplay improvements:
More powerups other than the plane-clearing bomb
Rising number of required bricks on a plane to clear it (i.e. as you advance in levels, more bricks are required to be put on a plane in order to clear it)

l. Known bugs:
Even though we used a non-bouncy low-dynamic-friction physics material, the bricks are a little bouncy. This is mostly not an issue.
When the board and camera are jittered a lot and quickly, sometimes the existing bricks will “fall off” of the board.
We once encountered a bug we could not replicate where pausing and unpausing caused two bricks to fall together.
